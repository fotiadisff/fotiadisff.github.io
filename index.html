<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a postdoc at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences at UT Austin, working with Prof. <a href=" https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/topcu">Ufuk Topcu</a>. I received my PhD in Aerospace Engineering (2024), as well as the MSc Degrees in Aerospace Engineering (2022) and Mathematics (2023), 
from Georgia Tech under the supervision Prof. <a href="https://kyriakos.ae.gatech.edu/">Kyriakos G. Vamvoudakis</a>. Previously, I obtained my Diploma (joint BSc and MSc degree) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (2018), 
where I was advised by Prof. <a href="https://arl.ee.auth.gr/people/rovithakis/">George A. Rovithakis</a>. <br><br>
You can find my CV <a href="pdfs/CV_web.pdf">here</a>.
<h2>Research</h2>
My primary research interests lie in the intersection of game theory, control theory, and machine learning, with applications to the security, autonomy, and verification of cyber-physical systems. I develop algorithms that provably enable cyber-physical systems to operate safely and securely in uncertain and adversarial environments.<h2>Teaching</h2>
